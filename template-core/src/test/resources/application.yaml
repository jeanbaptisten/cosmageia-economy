# When trying to run tests without any custom property, we are getting the following error:
#
#   Cannot invoke "org.hibernate.boot.spi.MetadataImplementor.getEntityBindings()" because
#   "this.metadata" is null
#
# This means that the issue can be located on Hibernate side or on Spring Data JPA one.
# The consequences are that things are not working out-of-the-box when relying on an H2 database,
# hence some explicit custom properties.
spring:
    datasource:
        driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver
        # By default, H2 is disk-based in a pretty similar way than SQLite. However, for testing
        # purposes (e.g. performance and portability of tests) we prefer to rely on an embedded and
        # in-memory mode. This is possible with H2, hence its use here but with some specificities:
        #
        # 1) "jdbc:h2:mem" is required for launching an embedded in-memory H2 database
        # 2) The explicit database name "testdb" forces multiple connections to target a same database
        #   (by default a new database is created per new connection, meaning opening multiple
        #   connections at once during tests can lead to unexpected and weird outcomes)
        # 3) "DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE" is recommended for testing purposes, otherwise the last connection
        #   to a database closes the database (which may not be wanted).
        #
